# minTE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Minimal TE 
The minTE repository provides parametrized short and ultrashort echo time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequence in the Pulseq format along with reconstruction functions. Sequence variations include 2D and 3D partially-rewound RF-spoiled radial GRE, and CODE.   

## Quickstart

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Set up the virtual environment making sure all packages listed in `requirements.txt` are installed 
3. Run `python run_all_unit_tests.py`
4. Run `python seq_gen_demo.py` to generate and visualize the sequence variations.
### Option 2: Google Colab Notebook
